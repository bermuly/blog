My main tasks of this week were:
1. Laboratory work on "Modeling"
2. Laboratory works on "Operating systems"

I easily coped with the first point due to the rather long use of Python. There were no big problems with the second point. Although it was possible to do everything faster.
I think I wasn't particularly productive this week because I didn't keep the balance of work and rest.
Next week, I should pay more attention to the reasonable allocation of time.
